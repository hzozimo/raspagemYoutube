"@samslara","She's more reasonable and advanced than half of the people I know right now."
"@tomasusan","""Of that I have absolutely no doubt.""  I love that despite all of the power that Picard commands, he genuinely admires others simply for their attitudes and potential."
"@f7supercereal","This is Star Trek at its finest."
"@williambarnes5023","""As seen from high above.""
""Yet we do not fall...""
""We do fall, but we are moving sideways so quickly that we miss, and so we continue falling, and continue missing."""
"@UNLebanon","It's amazing how young students think that ancient people were ""stupid"" for not having the technology we have today.  Then I show them this scene, and the light bulbs start going off over their heads."
"@strings1586","I absolutely love how the moment she understands what Picard is conveying, she begins to investigate the ship and her surroundings, and the possibility that her people could become like the population of the Enterprise."
"@grapes008","""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" - Arthur C. Clark"
"@wannamontana4130","Honoring Roddenberry's positive belief in humanity's future:  ""Perhaps one day my people will .....    Of this I have no doubt!"""
"@doingtime20","When good writing, good direction and good acting join forces."
"@DavidAWA","""You see.  My people used to shoot animals with bows and live in caves and then built huts.  Then we learned you could set arrows on fire and shoot them at the huts of others and shoot the people  as they fled their burning huts.  Then they leaned how to build bigger huts out of stone.  So we built a machine that could throw rocks to destroy those stone huts.  Now this is where things get really interesting..."""
"@stratfordbaby","This was an absolutely BEAUTIFUL and WONDERFUL episode for me as an anthropologist. Picard was so right on everything. It's crazy. I'm almost crying."
"@tranzorz6293","i really wish star trek was like this again."
"@literalsarcasm1830","I love how Picard is in awe of Nuria's curiosity and wonder. A true explorer."
"@Mxyzptlksac","No one delivers dialogue like Patrick Stewart"
"@hd_inmemoriam","0:41 Nobody ever seems to mention this mother of all facepalms. He facepalms so hard he has to walk out of frame."
"@AlastairjCarruthers","This is one of a handful of TNG moments that sends a tingle down my spine and brings a tear to my eye. Lovely stuff."
"@fincrazydragon","It's always nice how things work out when people are willing to listen to reason, rather than let themselves be blinded by hate and anger and fear."
"@graytonw5238","I was always drawn back to this scene because it had some of the best writing ever put on TV, but I never noticed one of the subtle details before.  Up to the point where Picard is trying to explain to Nuryea how a civilization advances over time, her eyes are wide open and her stance is stiff, like she's unsure about how to act around him.  But when she finally understands his point, at 2:44 you can see her eyes lower and her posture relax.  Great attention to detail, and great acting by the woman who portrayed Nuryea."
"@MsDemonBunny","I love how Picard presents the information. He teaches in the best way. Instead of explaining they simply have more advanced technology and hope she can grasp what that means, he asks questions about her people and what she already knows, essentially guiding her to her own realization and understanding. He gets her to think instead of just being in awe or overwhelmed."
"@pbdye1607","""Wow, there's a lot of water on my planet.  We really should build ships.""  (becomes the proto-Vulcan version of England)"
"@CaravanseraiSouthValley","This is legit inspiring."
"@Corehaven22",""" I never thought I'd see the clouds from the other side "".  Truly poetic."
"@geoffroberts1126","""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""  'Clarke's Third Law'"
"@danielweston9188","It started with her being amazed and ended with him being amazed!"
"@astercaster9522","I love the look of admiration he gives her at the end. The kind when a child says something unknowingly wise and profound."
"@DocuFlow","Without aspirational sci-fi I think the next generations are lost. Sci-fi has driven much of the science discoveries we have today, from Verne to Clarke to Roddenberry. Look up how Faraday was inspired by Verne, and wonder where we’d be without his contributions to science."
"@YD-uq5fi","Some things in 2023 would be hard to explain even to people from 1989, when this episode aired."
"@tonyjackson4078","The basic simple concept of Star Trek is at some point we as humans stopped being scared of each other, and wanted a greater destiny."
"@SeattleSandro","Who Watches the Watchers is one of the BEST episodes of any Star Trek for its writing and acting."
"@pitodesign","She's not like: ""Oh, my world is a sphere?"""
"@coreymoore1443","If you tried this with a proto-Klingon race:
Picard: Now how would she react?
Proto-Klingon: I think she would fear me.
Picard: Just as you fear me.
Proto-Klingon: Oh, so I should kill you?
Picard: <facepalm>"
"@slyguythreeonetwonine3172","""Yet we do not fall.""

Orbiral Mechanics: False, you are falling so fast that you are falling around the object rather than into it."
"@ChristopherNealBUSHIDO49ERS","What a fantastic scene!  Beautifully written and masterfully acted."
"@jeremy1860","Whenever I think of that real Trek feels like, this is the episode and moment I remember "
"@terryrose4804","Great! I'm now stuck on Star Trek clips and ""Sharpe's Waterloo"", etc. (Sean Bean) movies and clips. :)"
"@ninsnumber1fan","one of my favorite episodes. After ""the inner light"" of course."
"@cranberriesdoodle1450","The writing on this show is legendary!"
"@ultramaximusreviews","Great line. ""Of that I have absolutely no doubt."""
"@whatthafuckisthis","this scene together with the end of inner light and picard playing the flute with daren on the jefferies tube allways brings a tear to my eyes"
"@kjadfhgioaudbfvilaeu","Such a beautiful moment...
I absolutely adore the episodes (of any ST series) where they interact with civilizations that aren't as advanced."

"@sirlancerstien","Continue to upload these clips, I love this whole episode."
"@windwalker5765","""My people once lived in caves.""
music cuts in
""It's been a long road, gettin' from there to here..."""
"@craig5322","What an amazingly humble and good hearted person"
"@baconcoghill","You can tell at the end of the video that Picard was imagining both of their peoples working together, manning starships together and exploring worlds he couldn't even dream of."
"@importantname","intelligence is the ability to imagine what might exist but does not yet; the opposite is to deny that it is possible, because it does not exist"
"@tommyrick4687","Great clip great scene. Captures some of the best ideals of star trek"
"@pbdye1607","""I do not fear you any longer.""
""Good, because if you knew how much destructive potential we have on this ship I'd have never snapped you out of your reverent zealotry."""
"@ihavetwofaces","Props for uploading such a high definition version of this amazing scene."
"@petestevenson1004","One of the best moments in the entire series.  Among my top favourites.."
"@techpriest4787","When the Picard face palms, then you angered the Picard!"
"@peterah7957","I find when I revisit this show, these moments pull at my emotions. I think it's a testiment to the shows quality of writing and also the acting in this scene."
"@199NickYT","This may be my favorite scene of this entire series. I can't get enough of it."
"@allyourpie4323","Picard:  Of that I have absolutely no doubt...

Kirk:  ...because your body is out of this world!"
"@Ambienfinity","Another wonderful episode, made moving by fantastic performances, particularly Patrick Stewart."
"@normanred9212","They are related to Vulcans and Romulans, of course he has no doubt lol"
"@mrjasonwhite73","One of the very best episodes."
"@GORT70","That last line Picard gives is the most top shelf compliment he’s ever given."
"@gravijiga","Beautiful Star Trek moment. Fantastic series."
