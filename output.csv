"@tomasusan","""Of that I have absolutely no doubt.""  I love that despite all of the power that Picard commands, he genuinely admires others simply for their attitudes and potential.","781"

"@UNLebanon","It's amazing how young students think that ancient people were ""stupid"" for not having the technology we have today.  Then I show them this scene, and the light bulbs start going off over their heads.","516"
"@strings1586","I absolutely love how the moment she understands what Picard is conveying, she begins to investigate the ship and her surroundings, and the possibility that her people could become like the population of the Enterprise.","321"

"@DavidAWA","""You see.  My people used to shoot animals with bows and live in caves and then built huts.  Then we learned you could set arrows on fire and shoot them at the huts of others and shoot the people  as they fled their burning huts.  Then they leaned how to build bigger huts out of stone.  So we built a machine that could throw rocks to destroy those stone huts.  Now this is where things get really interesting...""","117"
"@stratfordbaby","This was an absolutely BEAUTIFUL and WONDERFUL episode for me as an anthropologist. Picard was so right on everything. It's crazy. I'm almost crying.","126"
"@tranzorz6293","i really wish star trek was like this again.","237"
"@literalsarcasm1830","I love how Picard is in awe of Nuria's curiosity and wonder. A true explorer.","137"

"@hd_inmemoriam","0:41 Nobody ever seems to mention this mother of all facepalms. He facepalms so hard he has to walk out of frame.","163"
"@AlastairjCarruthers","This is one of a handful of TNG moments that sends a tingle down my spine and brings a tear to my eye. Lovely stuff.","260"
"@fincrazydragon","It's always nice how things work out when people are willing to listen to reason, rather than let themselves be blinded by hate and anger and fear.","125"
"@graytonw5238","I was always drawn back to this scene because it had some of the best writing ever put on TV, but I never noticed one of the subtle details before.  Up to the point where Picard is trying to explain to Nuryea how a civilization advances over time, her eyes are wide open and her stance is stiff, like she's unsure about how to act around him.  But when she finally understands his point, at 2:44 you can see her eyes lower and her posture relax.  Great attention to detail, and great acting by the woman who portrayed Nuryea.","147"
"@MsDemonBunny","I love how Picard presents the information. He teaches in the best way. Instead of explaining they simply have more advanced technology and hope she can grasp what that means, he asks questions about her people and what she already knows, essentially guiding her to her own realization and understanding. He gets her to think instead of just being in awe or overwhelmed.","10"

"@danielweston9188","It started with her being amazed and ended with him being amazed!","6"
"@astercaster9522","I love the look of admiration he gives her at the end. The kind when a child says something unknowingly wise and profound.","17"
"@DocuFlow","Without aspirational sci-fi I think the next generations are lost. Sci-fi has driven much of the science discoveries we have today, from Verne to Clarke to Roddenberry. Look up how Faraday was inspired by Verne, and wonder where we’d be without his contributions to science.","7"
"@YD-uq5fi","Some things in 2023 would be hard to explain even to people from 1989, when this episode aired.","23"
"@tonyjackson4078","The basic simple concept of Star Trek is at some point we as humans stopped being scared of each other, and wanted a greater destiny.","30"

"@coreymoore1443","If you tried this with a proto-Klingon race:
Picard: Now how would she react?
Proto-Klingon: I think she would fear me.
Picard: Just as you fear me.
Proto-Klingon: Oh, so I should kill you?
Picard: <facepalm>","47"
